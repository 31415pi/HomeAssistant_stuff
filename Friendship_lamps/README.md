Made to mimick friendship lamp operation where changing one lamp color / dimness adjusts a second lamp to match. 
Adjusting the second lamp similarly changes the first lamp.

Currently 3/4 operations are functional:
YES - LIGHT A RGB -> LIGHT B RGB
YES - LIGHT B RGB -> LIGHT A RGB
NO  - LIGHT A COLOR_TEMP (WHITE) -> LIGHT B COLOR_TEMP (WHITE)
YES - LIGHT B COLOR_TEMP (WHITE) -> LIGHT A COLOR_TEMP (WHITE)

Need to add "effects", "flow" and "scene" state copiers to have it "fully functional".
I think there is an easier way to do this, than individual automations/scripts.
There might need to have a delay in them as well. Unsure if its important rn.

Made these for my partner, Holly Pop, so we can feel connected while our shitty landlords prevent us from hanging out irl.
